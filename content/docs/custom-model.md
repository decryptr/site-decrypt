### Downloading data

Before everything, let's load the needed libraries in R.

```
library(keras)
library(decryptr)
```

You can download the data from our Google Storage using the R code below. It will contain around 13k classified captcha images that can be read with decryptr. The captcha comes from Receita Federal Brasileira and has the following format:

![](/img/sample-captcha.png)

```r
download.file(
  "https://storage.googleapis.com/decryptr/data-raw/rfb.zip",
  "rfb.zip"
)

unzip("rfb.zip", exdir = "rfb")
```

### Reading and preprocessing

decryptr has some usefull functions to read and transform the images to the data structure needed to train the models.
The simplest way to transform the data is by running the code below:

```r
captchas <- list.files("rfb/", full.names = TRUE, pattern = ".*png") %>%
  read_captcha(ans_in_path = TRUE, vocab = c(letters, 0:9)) %>%
  join_captchas()
```

We can then split our dataset into training and validation sets.

```r
set.seed(902192)
i <- sample.int(captchas$n, 10000)

train <- list(y = captchas$y[i,,,drop = FALSE], x = captchas$x[i,,,,drop = FALSE])
test <- list(y = captchas$y[-i,,,drop = FALSE], x = captchas$x[-i,,,,drop = FALSE])
```

### Model specification in keras

Below we will specify a simple 3-layer CNN model using the keras sequential API. We will then compile the model defining the loss function and optimizers.

```r
model <- keras_model_sequential()
model %>%
  layer_conv_2d(
    input_shape = dim(train$x)[-1],
    filters = 16,
    kernel_size = c(5, 5),
    padding = "same",
    activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_max_pooling_2d() %>%
  layer_conv_2d(
    filters = 32,
    kernel_size = c(5, 5),
    padding = "same",
    activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_max_pooling_2d() %>%
  layer_conv_2d(
    filters = 64,
    kernel_size = c(5, 5),
    padding = "same",
    activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_max_pooling_2d() %>%
  layer_flatten() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 256) %>%
  layer_dropout(.1) %>%
  layer_dense(units = prod(dim(train$y)[-1])) %>%
  layer_reshape(target_shape = dim(train$y)[-1]) %>%
  layer_activation("softmax")


model %>%
  compile(
    optimizer = "adam",
    loss = "categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics = "accuracy")
```

### Model fitting

We can the fit the model by calling the `fit` function with the specified model and data (for training and validation).

```
model %>%
  fit(
    x = train$x,
    y = train$y,
    batch_size = 32,
    epochs = 20,
    shuffle = TRUE,
    validation_data = list(test$x, test$y)
  )
```

After training the model we should persist it to disk in order to be able to make predictions later. We can save it by calling:

```
save_model_hdf5(model, "rfb.hdf5")
```

Now your are able to [make predictions for new captchas](/docs/predictions-model-file/).
