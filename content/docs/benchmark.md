Once loaded to memory, keras models run very quickly Also, we don't run any pre-processing on the image, so decryption is blazing fast.

```
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(decrypt = decrypt(captcha, model))
## Unit: milliseconds
##     expr      min       lq     mean   median       uq     max neval
